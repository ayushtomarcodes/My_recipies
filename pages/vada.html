        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Rinse 1 cup urad dal (husked and split or whole black gram) a few times in water. Then soak the lentils in 2.5 to 3 cups water for at least 4 to 5 hours or up to overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain and discard the water. Add the soaked urad dal to a grinder jar. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons fresh water or as needed. Just be sure not to make the batter too thin!
            </li>
            <li>
                Begin to grind or blend the urad dal to a smooth batter. The batter should be fluffy and thick.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue to grind at intervals by scraping the sides with a spatula. If your mixer or grinder becomes hot, then wait for a few minutes until it cools down.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue to grind or blend until you achieve a smooth, fluffy batter. Remember there should be no fine grits or chunks of urad dal in the batter.
            </li>
        </ol>
